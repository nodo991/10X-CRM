# 10X CRM

### About
10X CRM is a simplified customer relationship management tool for sales managers. A user can sign up, log in, track a client base end-to-end (add, delete, filter, search, sort, notes, follow-up reminders), see a live dashboard of their pipeline, and manage their own profile — all with data persisted in the browser via `localStorage`. Built as a vanilla JavaScript exam project — no frameworks, no libraries.

### Features (CORE + FULL)
- **Sign Up** with 6 validation rules (name length, email format/uniqueness, password strength, password match), exact error messages, and a success toast before redirecting to Login.
- **Login** with session persistence (reload-safe) and a generic "Invalid email or password" message on failure (never reveals which part was wrong).
- **Auth Guard**: protected pages (`dashboard`, `clients`, `profile`) redirect to Login when logged out; public pages (`index`, `signup`) redirect to Dashboard when already logged in.
- **Dashboard**: personalized greeting, live clock, 4 live stat cards (Total Clients, Active Deals, Won Revenue, New This Week), Pipeline Overview by status, and the 5 most recently added clients.
- **Clients**: loads 30 clients from the DummyJSON API on first visit, then persists to `localStorage`. Search by name/company, filter by status chip, sort (newest / name / deal value) — all combinable without mutating the underlying data. Add Client (validated, `POST`), Delete (confirmation + `DELETE`), inline status change, client-details modal with notes history and a 1-minute follow-up reminder toast.
- **Profile**: edit name/company, change password (old password verified, new password can't match the old one), and Reset CRM Data (reloads the client list from the API without touching the account).
- Dark/light theme toggle, shared and persisted across all pages (default: dark).
- Toast notifications and inline field errors everywhere — no `alert()` (except the allowed `confirm()` for destructive actions).
- Loading state + error/Retry UI if the DummyJSON API is unreachable.

### Tech Stack
- HTML5, CSS3 (custom properties for theming)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): `fetch`, `async/await`, `localStorage`, DOM APIs
- [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com) as a mock REST API

### How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server (e.g. VS Code "Live Server").
3. No build step, no dependencies.

### Notes on the localStorage password (security)
Storing plaintext passwords in `localStorage` is unacceptable in a real product — passwords belong on a server, hashed. This project does it only because it's a backend-free learning exercise.
